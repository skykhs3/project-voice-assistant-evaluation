To provide a more accurate and helpful response, I'll need to know more about your schedule. However, based on the provided data, I can suggest a few options:

1. **Daily Weather Forecast**: You can tell me which specific dates you're interested in (e.g., 2025-01-25), and I'll give you the weather forecast for that day.
2. **Event-Specific Weather**: If you provide me with your schedule events, such as "Travel to Seoul on January 24" or "Attend a meeting in Busan on January 26", I can look up the weather forecast for those specific locations and dates.
3. **General Weather Trend**: Since the provided data includes daily weather forecasts for multiple days, we can discuss general trends, such as:
	* Temperature: Is it getting warmer or colder over time?
	* Humidity: Will it be humid or dry during your scheduled events?
	* Condition: Are there any specific conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy) that might affect your schedule?

Which option would you like to choose?
